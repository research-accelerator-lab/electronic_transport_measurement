# GUI
Graphical user interfaces for the two and four terminal measurements

Each folder runs a different type of electronic transport measurement procedure with the assistance of ATLAS for
high throughput testing.

For example, in the `Automatic Transfer Curve` folder you can run `python auto_fet_gui.py` on the command line of your
Python environment with PyMeasure installed.

Post data collection, procedures with a gate-voltage sweep were updated to better implement sweep rate requests.
